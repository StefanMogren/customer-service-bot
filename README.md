# customer-service-bot

A school task to create a customer service AI-chat bot for a fictional company.

## Uses LangGraph

@langchain/langgraph/web

https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview
Allows the model to answer questions to multiple users at the same time while also keeping track of the message history for each one.

I deem this inclusion useful since an AI-chat bot must be able to manage multiple conversations at the same time.
